# Aspire-project

For my Web technology project, I have created a website for the Aspire for Her Foundation, it is a not-for-profit (Section 8) company powered by extraordinary women leaders as mentors and role models. Aspire for Her Foundation primarily works on a C2B (College-to-Business) model creating online and offline programs for its members (18-25 year old women) through partnerships with forward-thinking, diversity-focused organisations and professionals.
